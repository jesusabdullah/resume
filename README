My resume is written in LaTeX, and once everything's back in order, there should be >1 compiled forms for your convenience:

* .pdf, which looks best, especially printed. Should fit on one page.

* .rtf, since a lot of people prefer MS Word-compatible formats. Might not fit on one page.

* .html (or something) for quick online viewing.

Other goals including separation of content from formatting, and creating two versions--one as a complete academic CV, and the other as a one-page industry resume.
